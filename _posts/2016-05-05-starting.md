> Today I started adding a lot of the infrastructure, which means easy (but no real) progress.

# Steps

0. Domain registration
1. AWS: S3, IAM (user & policy)
2. Cloudflare: https & DNS funk
3. Travis-CI: Push commits from GitHub to S3
4. Github: Public repo for the blog

Based all of this off the [one cent blog][one-cent] to get things rolling quickly.  Lots of stuff available for free (free is still good right - I am not the product, I am not the product...).

# Next

0. break the project down into mini-projects
1. create a timetable for those subtasks
2. execute the first of the subtasks

Does it make sense to break this down into 2 week cycles (_#SoAgileItHurtsRightNow_)?  Also I'm going to have to do something about the default fonts and layout on this blog, they need some work to _embrace the space_.

3. blog fonts and layout rethink
